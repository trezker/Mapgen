Note: 
The docs folder is old, this whole project hasn't been touched in years until it went up on github.
But read it anyway, it has some relevant information.

== New version WIP ==
I have started rebuilding the generator from scratch.
I'm using C++ and Allegro 5 and render the map directly to 3D with OpenGL.
I'm using mtrand instead of the crappy standard rand() because people were complaining in IRC.

=== Building ===
There's now a premake4 build script.

==== Old mapgen ====
The old mapgen builds using Allegro 4.4.
The project is commented out in the script, uncomment it to build.
The exe is build/mapgen

==== New Mapgen ====
This depends on a 3D library I made called Alledge. https://github.com/trezker/alledge
No GUI yet, but when I add it I'll probably use SWAG. https://github.com/trezker/SWAG
Exe is build/mapgen5

=== 3D view ===
Uses Allegros old software 3D routines. It doesn't matter how good your gfx hardware is.
But it runs nicely anyway on a modern computer.
