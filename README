Note: 
The docs folder is old, this whole project hasn't been touched in years until it went up on github.
But read it anyway, it has relevant information.

=== Building ===
There's now a premake4 build script.
This builds using Allegro 4.4.

=== 3D view ===
Uses Allegros old software 3D routines. It doesn't matter how good your gfx hardware is.
But it runs nicely anyway on a modern computer.
